For example, given the list `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]`, the `build_tree` function creates a tree where `1` is the root, `2` and `2` are its children, and so on, forming a structured binary tree. The `bt_path` function then performs a DFS to explore all paths from the root to the leaves. Starting at the root (`1`), it traverses to each leaf node, recording paths like `[1, 2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 5]`, `[1, 2, 6]`, and `[1, 2, 7]`, demonstrating how all possible root-to-leaf paths are discovered and returned. This approach efficiently finds all such paths by leveraging recursive DFS and backtracking to explore each potential route in the tree."

By using DFS, the function ensures that every potential path is explored, and backtracking allows it to efficiently navigate the tree without unnecessary re-computation.

Additionally, the space required to store the paths is proportional to the number of nodes, leading to an overall space complexity of O(N)."
